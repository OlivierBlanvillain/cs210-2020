Choose a group that has the same letter as your on-site rotation group ([epfl-covid19-studies](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/security-safety/en/health/coronavirus-covid19/students/)).
Groups 1-9 correspond to the time slot 13:15~14:00.
Groups 10-18 correspond to the time slot 14:15~15:00. 
Time slots are there for when you come on campus.

In case the on-site rotation group is too unbalanced and all groups get filled, please contact nicolas.stucki@epfl.ch to open new groups.

It is allowed but NOT recommended to join a group in another rotation as long as all the work is done remotely with your group (using Discord, Hangouts, Zoom, ...). In this case, you will NOT be able to come on campus to ask questions during the presidential session.

* For the exercise sessions: find the link to the workspace of your group in the form
  * If you work remotely you can just write down the solution directly in the workspace
  * If you solved it on paper or on a blackboard/whiteboard you can take a picture with your phone an paste it in the workspace
* This form is also used to initialize your programming assignments using your gaspar
* You should not change groups during the semester as we wont be tracking changes to the form
