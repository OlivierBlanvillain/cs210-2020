# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b e3 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2020/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-e3
cd cs210-e3
```
# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise 3: For-comprehensions

You are given three classes (`Student`, `Exam` and `Course` which are defined below) and the method `generatePassedExams`, which from a given list of students and a list of courses, generates a list of students and all their successfully passed courses together with the corresponding grade. A course is considered assuccessfully passed if the grade for that course is greater than 2.

```scala
case class Student(name: String, exams: List[Exam])
case class Exam(courseId: String, grade: Double)
case class Course(id: String, name: String)

def generatePassedExams(students: List[Student], courses: List[Course]): List[(String, String, Double)] = {
  for{
    s <- students
    e <- s.exams
    if e.grade > 2
    c <- courses
    if e.courseId == c.id
  } yield(s.name, c.name, e.grade)
}
```

Your task is to rewrite the method `generatePassedExams` to use `map`, `flatMap` and `filter` instead of the for-comprehension. The resulting method should of course have the same result as the for-comprehension above.
