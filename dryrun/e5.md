# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b e5 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2020/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-e5
cd cs210-e5
```

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise 5: FlatMap

Our new Java intern has written some imperative code. We would prefer a purely functional solution using pattern matching. Your task is to re-implement the intern code using functional programming.

```scala
def flatMap[T](list: List[T], f: T => List[T]): List[T] = {
  var in = list
  var out: List[T] = Nil
  while (in.nonEmpty) {
    out = out ::: f(in.head)
    in = in.tail
  }
  out
}
```
This solution is undesirable for several reasons:

 - it uses `var`-s and a `while` loop so it is not in the spirit of functional programming

 - it has worse than linear complexity in the output list because of the expression `out ::: f(in.head)`

Write a new implementation of the `flatMap` method that produces the same result but satisfies the following properties:

 1. no imperative constructs such as `var` and `while`

 2. use pattern matching instead of methods such as `nonEmpty`, `head`, `tail`

 3. it may define and implement additional methods

 4. any recursive method you implement must be tail-recursive

 5. it may only use the following methods on `List`: `::` and `:::`. Pattern matches are also allowed.

Note that these properties are not checked by the provided automated tests and will be reviewed manually.
