# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b e2 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2020/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-e2
cd cs210-e2
```
# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise 2: Graph Reachability

Consider the following case class definitions:

```scala
case class Node(id: Int)
case class Edge(from: Node, to: Node)
```

Let us represent a directed graph `G` as the list of all its edges (of type `List[Edge]`). We are interested in computing the set of all nodes reachable in **exactly** `n` steps from a set of initial nodes. Write a `reachable` function with the following signature to provide this functionality:

```scala
def reachable(n: Int, init: Set[Node], edges: List[Edge]): Set[Node]
```

You can assume that `n` >= 0.
